A set of ideas, values, and beliefs that is accepted by a society, a class, or some other socially significant group of people. This value system supports a series of norms, or definitions of acceptable behavior.
<p> Ideology therefore exerts significant influence over the individuals living within a society. Once the population has accepted an ideology, individuals will act according to the ideology's norms, or risk facing disciplinary measures.
</p>
<p><b>Theoretical Variations</b><br>
Marx focused on the controlling function of ideology. A capitalist system benefits those groups who control the means of production. In such a system, there is a threat of revolt from those whom the system oppresses. The dominant class uses ideology to neutralize this threat. Using its control over the means of information dissemination (e.g. in the media), the dominant class can impose its own ideology on the larger population. This ideology naturalizes the power structure of the existing system. In other words, it suggests that the existing system is the best possible system for all of the members of society (if not the only possible system). The coercion (which can be both overt/physical or covert/subconscious) by which the dominant class gains acceptance for its ideology is called ideological domination. Although the term ideology predates Marx, Marx's use of the term seems to have imbued it with some powerful and persistent connotations. Chief among these is the concept that ideology does not connote any set of values held by a group of people, but rather a system of beliefs held by the dominant class and inflicted upon the oppressed classes. Such a framework makes it difficult to analyze the constant power struggles that go on in a society for control of the value system.
</p>
To remedy this deficiency, Gramsci introduced the closely related concept of hegemony, which basically describes the situation in which a particular ideology has gained complete acceptance within a social group. The distinction made in the Stuart Hall text book is that hegemony is basically ideology without the Marxist connotation of a fixed system imposed by a dominant group (i.e. government). Hegemony is open to negotiation, or the constant power struggle between different social groups. As a theoretical concept, hegemony therefore allows for the investigation of this power struggle as it occurs in various media forms and other social sites.

Hegemony and the aspect of power also link ideology to Foucault's concept of power/knowledge. Knowledge consists of a system of meaning that is accepted by a group of people. Those who can control the system of meanings have power over the values of society and therefore the norms that regulate behavior (and even thought) according to these values. Different discourses struggle for control over the system of meaning and the power that comes with this control. In this way, a discourse is very similar to an ideology, in that it is a system of beliefs and practices. However, as with hegemony, discourse does not contain the overtone of "coming from the dominant class" that the term ideology has.

<li><a href="#REGULAR info">REGULAR</li></a>
<p id="REGULAR info">Regular study is the key to a stress free life and is the best way to avoid last minute panic and rote learning. At times, regular studies, accompanied by regular assignments and class tests, may become hectic for students.

The way to streamline the process and to strike a balance is to simply make regular studies interesting in your own way.
Here are some ways to keep your environment more conducive for studies, thus making it interesting, fun and fruitful at the same time:

 

The first and foremost thing to be done is to create time-slots for each subject. This can be done based on the priority of the subject, its difficulty level, or the proximity of an exam for that specific subject.

If a subject can wait for a day or two in your opinion, you may revisit it, thereby giving precedence to subjects that need immediate attention due to an approaching exam or a Q&A session at school.

 

Once you have planned the subjects you will be studying on a particular day, the next thing you need to do is to make your surroundings comfortable and conducive for studies.  

It is very important that your room is well-lit and well ventilated for complete concentration. Along with it, the room must have the right temperature to help you avoid crawling to a comfortable space and hence avoid all unnecessary distractions.

Taking good care of your surroundings while studying may help you calm your nerves and invest your undivided attention to what you are studying at that moment.

Nibbling on healthy snacks is a great way to keep you going. It is also a form of treat you give yourself, every time you complete a specific set target.

Make sure to munch on healthy snacks rich in vitamins and minerals and are a powerhouse of energy to help you fare throughout the day. Nuts like almonds, fruits drizzled with maple syrup, baked potato chips etc. are some good snacking options to consider, Make sure only to munch on healthy foods and keep unwholesome food at bay. Always remember, the healthier you eat, the healthier you keep your mind.

 

Quite often, students don't get enough time to go through the entire section of each subject that was taught in the class. The best way to recall everything that was taught and to test your memory is to incorporate use of practice sheets when studying out-side classrooms.

This would help you brush up and remember everything that was taught in classroom and may also help you gain better understanding of the topic. Practice sheets make regular studies a fun exercise and reduce overall burden. It is the best tool to stay abreast of day-to-day learnings, to identifying your focus areas and to evaluate yourself time and again.

 

Despite all your efforts if you still find regular studies monotonous and feel that there is a need to mug up difficult topics, try using flashcards to make the learning process more interesting and fun. When you make flash cards, write down the points you need to learn neatly, and use it every now and then to memorize the pointers.

A physical card to hold and carry around will make it easy for you to memorise and retain the information much effectively. You may use it while you are in school or at home or even when you are engaged in some other activity.

 

Last but not the least, put the technology you have access to, to the best use. Create an online study group to exchange notes with your peers. It may simply be a WhatsApp group or a group on any social media platform for you and your classmates to connect outside the classroom.

It would help to keep the study points fresh in memory, the things you have learnt and also learn from others and understand their perspective towards the subject.

Daily exchange of short notes and pointers, by the end of the day would come handy for everyone to have a quick recap of what was taught in class and stay updated all the time

<p id="PDP info">Professional Degree Program (PDP)


core definition

Professional Degree Program is a structured and supported process to assist students in arranging their own personal educational and career progression.


explanatory context

Professional Degree Program is part of the development, in the School, of progress files.


Personal Development Planning is a structured and supported process undertaken by an individual to reflect upon their own learning, performance and/or achievement and to plan for their personal, educational and career development. The primary objective for PDP is to improve the capacity of individuals to understand what and how they are learning, and to review, plan and take responsibility for their own learning, helping students:
<ol type="i">
<li>become more effective, independent and confident self-directed learners;</li>
<li>understand how they are learning and relate their learning to a wider context;</li> 
<li>improve their general skills for study and career management;</li>
<li>articulate personal goals and evaluate progress towards their achievement;</li>
<li>and encourage a positive attitude to learning throughout life;</li>
The QAA (undated) modified the definition as follows:

Professional Degree Program (PDP) is a structured and supported process undertaken by a learner to reflect upon their own learning, performance and/or achievement and to plan for their personal, educational and career development. It is an inclusive process, open to all learners, in all HE provision settings, and at all levels. QAA Scotland works with the Higher Education Academy (HEA) and Centre for Recording Achievement (CRA) to help higher education institutions in Scotland to implement PDP.

 

The QAA website in 2018 no longer has any reference to PDP.

 

 
The Higher Education Academy (2012) repeated the first part of the QAA definition without attributing source:

PDP is defined as 'a structured and supported process undertaken by an individual to reflect upon their own learning, performance and/or achievement and to plan for their personal, educational and career development'.
PDP embraces a range of approaches to learning that connect planning (an individual's goals and intentions for learning or achievement), doing (aligning actions to intentions), recording (thoughts, ideas, experiences, in order to understand and evidence the process and results of learning) and reflection (reviewing and evaluating experiences and the results of learning).


Wojtczak (2002) defines a Personal Development Plan (PDP) in the context of medical education as:

A list of educational needs, development goals and actions and processes, compiled by learners and used in systematic management and periodic reviews of learning. It is an integral part of reflective practice and self-directed learning for professionals. It can be equally valuable in teacher-directed medical training for maintaining learner-centered approaches and shared objectives. PDP can be used to manage learning needs systematically, to set development and performance improvement goals, organize learning activities and review outcomes. Some educational organizations accept completed plans for accredited professional development and health managers link them with appraisals.

 

In the University of Bolton's Careers Service's (undated (c. 2012), p. 6) The Employability Guide states:

Personal development planning is a process that allows you to think about, and then record, your skills, achievements and learning outcomes. By completing it you will identify which areas you need to develop further, helping you to plan for your future and your career.

PDP is arrnaged through the University in different ways. It can be built into course programmes, addressed through personal tutoring and supported by other central services such as the Careers Service.


associated issues

The Guidelines for HE Progress Files, developed by CVCP (now, Universities UK and including Universities Scotland), SCOP, QAA and LTSN, suggest that the PDP element of the policy objectives should be operational across the whole higher education system and for all higher education awards by 2005–06.
